        <li>1 ½ lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz) can fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (11 oz) can Mexicorn, drained</li>
        <li>1 (4 oz) can diced green chilies</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese (or sub Monterey Jack or a Mexican blend cheese)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
    </ul>
        <h2 class="secHeader" >Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of wax paper and use a meat mallet to pound the breasts into an even thickness across, about 1 to 1 ¼ inches.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, oregano, salt and pepper. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with half of the seasoning mix and reserve the rest.</li>
            <li>Heat the canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. (Or use a very heavy-bottomed deep skillet that's oven-proof.) Add the chicken and cook on one side until well browned, about 3-4 minutes, then flip over and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side. Remove from the pan. (The chicken will continue cooking later.)</li>
            <li>Add the onion to the pan and sauté for 3-4 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the black beans, diced tomatoes, corn, green chilies and the reserved seasoning mix. Stir to combine and warm through.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken breasts back to the pan and nestle into the bean mixture. Sprinkle the cheese over the entire skillet.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake at 400 for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. (A meat thermometer should read 165 degrees F.)</li>
            <li>Squeeze the fresh lime juice over the skillet and serve the cowboy chicken with any desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
